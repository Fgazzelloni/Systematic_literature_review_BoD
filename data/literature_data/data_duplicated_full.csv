"1","Melse & Kramers",1998,"Berekeningen van de ziektelast in Nederland. Achtergronddocument bij VTV-1997 deel III, hoofdstuk 7","Dit rapport bestaat uit twee delen. Deel A is een vrijwel integrale weergave van de tekst van hoofdstuk 7 uit VTV-1997 III: Gezondheid en levensverwachting gewogen. In dit hoofdstuk is een schatting gemaakt van de ziektelast in Nederland voor de in VTV-1997 geselecteerde aandoeningen , op basis van elders berekende wegingsfactoren voor ziekte en de gegevens over prevalentie, incidentie en verloren levensjaren die voor VTV-1997 verzameld zijn. De ziektelast wordt uitgedrukt in DALY's (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), die een optelling zijn van ziektejaar-equivalenten en verloren levensjaren. De ziektejaar-equivalenten worden berekend als de prevalentie maal een wegingsfactor voor de ernst van de aandoening. Een opvallend resultaat was dat de hart- en vaatziekten en kankers verantwoordelijk waren voor het grootste deel van de verloren levensjaren, terwijl de psychische aandoeningen en de lichamelijke chronische aandoeningen juist het grootste deel van de ziektejaarequivalenten voor hun rekening namen. In de beschouwing worden de belangrijkste onzekerheden en problemen van deze benadering besproken. Deel B bevat de berekeningen van de ziektejaar-equivalenten en DALY's per aandoening, gerangschikt naar ICD-hoofdgroep.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/431501028.html"

First, new data sources that have been released or reported since GBD 2016 have been incorporated. Second, for the first time, estimates of age-sexspecific population generated in the GBD are used in the estimation of all-cause mortality, whereas previous efforts by the GBD used the UN Population Division estimates of population by age and sex. Third, statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved. Lastly, we have extended the analysis and reporting of age-specific mortality back to 1950 to further contribute to research and analyses of longterm trends in mortality and life expectancy.","The Lancet","https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31891-9/fulltext"

As an assessment it is purely descriptive. The chapter “Main results” contains references to the possible risk factors. The atlas is meant to serve as an impetus and an empirical basis for research on causes. It may be of benefi t for the development of hypotheses on the underlying causal factors and may incite specialized epidemiological studies in which these hypotheses can be tested. Finally, the atlas may contribute to an improvement in health-consciousness and serve to implement health policy strategies. In problem areas with a high risk of death, prevention and education programs could be intensifi ed, independently of whether or not the underlying causal factors have been identifi ed. For heath-planning purposes, specialist medical examination and treatment programs would need to be included in the strategies taken","Statistics Austria","https://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/PeopleSociety/health/causes_of_death/index.html"
