"1","AbouZahn & Vaughan",2000,"Assessing the burden of sexual and reproductive ill-health: questions regarding the use of disability-adjusted life years","The use of the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as the unit in which to calculate the burden of disease associated with reproductive ill-health has given rise to considerable debate. Criticisms include the failure to address the problem of missing and inadequate epidemiological data, inability to deal adequately with co-morbidities, and lack of transparency in the process of ascribing disability weights to sexual and reproductive health conditions. Many of these criticisms could be addressed within the current DALY framework and a number of suggestions to do so are made. These suggestions include: (1) developing an international research strategy to determine the incidence and prevalence of reproductive ill-health and diseases, including the risk of long-term complications; (2) undertaking a research strategy using case studies, population-based surveillance data and longitudinal studies to identify, evaluate and utilize more of the existing national data sources on sexual and reproductive health; (3) comprehensively mapping the natural history of sexual and reproductive health conditions--in males and in females--and their sequelae, whether physical or psychological; (4) developing valuation instruments that are adaptable for both chronic and acute health states, that reflect a range of severity for each health state and can be modified to reflect prognosis; (5) undertaking a full review of the DALY methodology to determine what changes may be made to reduce sources of methodological and gender bias. Despite the many criticisms of the DALY as a measurement unit, it represents a major conceptual advance since it permits the combination of life expectancy and levels of dysfunction into a single measure. Measuring reproductive ill-health by counting deaths alone is inadequate for a proper understanding of the dimensions of the problem because of the young age of many of the deaths associated with reproductive ill-health and the large component of years lived with disability from many of the associated conditions.","Bull WHO","https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eur.idm.oclc.org/pmc/articles/PMC2560755/"

"8","Bijkerk et al",2015,"Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland, 2014 [State of Infectious Diseases in the Netherlands, 2014]","De wereldwijde epidemie van ebola was de meest in het oog springende infectieziekte van dit jaar. In Nederland waren geen ebolapatiënten, maar is veel tijd besteed aan de voorbereiding om patiënten te kunnen verzorgen en verspreiding van het virus te voorkomen. Daarnaast was er de uitbraak van mazelen in Nederland, die in 2013 begon en eindigde in de eerste maanden van 2014. In die periode zijn verspreid over Nederland 2700 zieken gemeld en is 3,9 miljoen euro besteed om de epidemie te bestrijden. De grootste kostenposten waren de werkzaamheden van de betrokken GGD'en en de kosten van ziekenhuisopname van ernstig zieke patiënten. Dit blijkt uit de Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland 2014, een jaarlijks rapport dat inzicht geeft in ontwikkelingen van infectieziekten bij de Nederlandse bevolking. Daarnaast worden elk jaar de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van de infectieziekten in het buitenland beschreven die voor Nederland relevant zijn. Met deze jaarlijkse uitgave informeert het RIVM beleidsmakers van het ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport (VWS). Het thema van dit jaar zijn de kosten voor de behandeling, preventie en bestrijding van de infectieziekten. Om inzicht in de kosten te krijgen, zijn deze berekend voor de mazelenepidemie en voor de Salmonella Thompson-uitbraak door gerookte zalm in 2012. Voor deze twee is gekozen omdat ze omvangrijk waren en verspreid over heel Nederland zieken veroorzaakten. Bij de Salmonella Thompson-uitbraak zijn 1149 ziektegevallen gemeld die met behulp van laboratoriumdiagnostiek werden vastgesteld en is 1,7 miljoen euro aan kosten gemaakt. De grootste kostenposten betroffen de inzet van de Nederlandse Voedsel en Warenautoriteit (NVWA) om de bron van de besmetting op te sporen en de kosten van ziekenhuisopname van ernstig zieke patiënten. In de studie staat ook beschreven hoe de kosten en de opbrengsten van interventies met elkaar kunnen worden vergeleken. Met kosteneffectiviteitstudies kan worden bepaald hoe budgetten het meest efficiënt voor de gezondheidszorg kunnen worden ingezet. In dit rapport zijn de meest gebruikte methoden van kosteneffectiviteitsstudies en bijbehorende uitkomstmaten toegelicht.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2015-0117.pdf"
"9","Bijkerk et al",2015,"Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland, 2015 [State of Infectious Diseases in the Netherlands, 2015]","New disease burden estimates have also been made in this State of 35 infectious diseases in the Netherlands between 2012 and 2014. This disease burden reflects the number of years that people no longer spend in good health because of an infectious disease. Some infectious diseases, such as gastrointestinal infections, are common but generally do not cause serious complaints. Other infections, such as tetanus, are rare, but cause relatively many deaths. A health measure that combines these aspects of diseases is the Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DALY Disability Adjusted Life Year ). The average annual disease burden for the total Dutch population was highest for influenza (8,653 DALYs / year). The lowest disease burden was estimated for diphtheria (0.6 DALYs / year). The disease burden of infections that are vaccinated against is low thanks to the National Vaccination Program.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2016-0069.pdf"
"10","Bijkerk et al",2014,"Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland, 2012 [State of Infectious Diseases in the Netherlands, 2012]","De uitbraken van kinkhoest en Salmonella Thompson in 2012 waren de meest in het oog springende infectieziekten van dat jaar. Dit blijkt uit de Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland 2012, die inzicht geeft in ontwikkelingen van infectieziekten bij de Nederlandse bevolking. Daarnaast worden ook de ontwikkelingen in het buitenland beschreven die voor Nederland relevant zijn. Met deze jaarlijkse uitgave informeert het RIVM beleidsmakers van het ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport (VWS). Elk jaar komt er een thema aan bod; dit keer de ontwikkelingen in vaccins en vaccinatieprogramma's en de relevantie daarvan voor de Nederlandse volksgezondheid. De meeste vaccinaties worden gegeven vanuit nationale vaccinatieprogramma's, zoals het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma (ongeveer 2 miljoen prikken per jaar) en het Nationale Griep Preventieprogramma (ongeveer 3,5 miljoen prikken per jaar). Daarnaast wordt gevaccineerd bij onder andere reizigers, medische risicogroepen zoals mensen zonder milt en werknemers die een verhoogd risico hebben om een infectieziekte tijdens het werk op te lopen, zoals personeel in de zorg en in laboratoria. Per vaccinatieprogramma is in kaart gebracht in welke mate de ziekten voorkomen, wat het percentage gevaccineerden is en het aantal gegeven vaccins. Het percentage gevaccineerden bij reizigers, medische risicogroepen en werknemers is onbekend. Veranderingen in de maatschappij zorgen ervoor dat bepaalde groeperingen kritisch staan ten opzichte van vaccinaties. In het jaaroverzicht staat ook beschreven welke groepen afzien van vaccinatie, zoals orthodoxgereformeerden (circa 250.000 mensen) en antroposofen. Ook wordt de motivatie en houding van ouders besproken om hun kind wel of niet te laten vaccineren. Daarnaast komt de toename van het aantal ouderen en chronisch zieken aan bod. Hun gevoeligheid voor infecties maakt hen een belangrijke groep om (nieuwe) vaccinaties te overwegen.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/publicaties/state-of-infectious-disease-in-netherlands-2012"

"12","Bijkerk et al",2014,"Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland, 2013 [State of Infectious Diseases in the Netherlands, 2013]","De uitbraak van mazelen in 2013 was de meest in het oog springende infectieziekte van dat jaar. Dit blijkt uit de Staat van Infectieziekten in Nederland 2013, die inzicht geeft in ontwikkelingen van infectieziekten bij de Nederlandse bevolking. Daarnaast worden de ontwikkelingen in het buitenland beschreven die voor Nederland relevant zijn. Met deze jaarlijkse uitgave informeert het RIVM beleidsmakers van het ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport (VWS). Elk jaar komt in de Staat van Infectieziekten een thema aan bod; dit jaar is dat de hoeveelheid jaren in goede gezondheid die verloren gaan (ziektelast) door infectieziekten. Sommige infectieziekten, zoals maag-darminfecties, komen erg vaak voor maar veroorzaken over het algemeen geen ernstige klachten. Andere daarentegen, bijvoorbeeld tetanus, komen slechts zelden voor maar veroorzaken relatief veel sterfgevallen. Een gezondheidsmaat die deze aspecten van ziekten combineert is de Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). Voor 32 infectieziekten is de ziektelast in Nederland tussen 2007 en 2011 geschat. De gemiddelde jaarlijkse ziektelast voor de totale Nederlandse bevolking was het hoogst voor ernstige pneumokokkenziekte (9444 DALY's per jaar) en griep (8670 DALY's per jaar), die respectievelijk 16 en 15 procent van de totale ziektelast van alle 32 infectieziekten vertegenwoordigen. Na polio en difterie (0 gevallen in de onderzochte periode), werd de laagste ziektelast geschat voor rodehond op 0,14 DALY's per jaar. De ziektelast voor deze ziekten is zo laag dankzij het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma. De ziektelast per individu varieerde van 0,2 DALY's per honderd infecties voor giardiasis (diarree die wordt veroorzaakt door een parasiet), tot 5081 en 3581 DALY's per honderd infecties voor respectievelijk hondsdolheid en een variant van de ziekte van Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Voor alle ziektelaststudies geldt dat de resultaten afhankelijk zijn van de modelparameters en aannames, en van de beschikbaarheid van accurate gegevens over de mate waarin de ziekten voorkomen. Toch kunnen deze schattingen informatief zijn voor beleidsmakers binnen de gezondheidszorg om prioriteiten te kunnen aanbrengen in preventieve en andere maatregelen.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/150205001.pdf"

"16","Bouwknegt et al",2011,"Disease burden of food-related pathogens in the Netherlands, 2011","The Ministry of VWS has requested RIVM to present an annual update on the number of illnesses caused by 14 enteric pathogens. These pathogens can be transmitted by food, the environment, animals and humans. The number of persons who are ill and who die from the infections is expressed in DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years), a measure of the disease burden in the population. The total disease burden caused by the 14 pathogens decreased from 14,900 DALY in 2010 to 13,900 DALY in 2011. The share of foodborne transmission in this burden decreased from 6,440 to 6,230 DALY. The decrease in disease burden was a result of a decrease in the incidence of disease by Salmonella spp., rotavirus, norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Furthermore, fewer persons died from an infection with Listeria monocytogenes compared to 2010. The number of perinatal listeriosis cases has doubled, increasing the burden of perinatal listeriosis by 50% compared to 2010 to 156 DALY per year in 2011. The incidence of campylobacteriosis continued to increase in 2011. Furthermore, an overall increasing trend in norovirus incidence was observed in the period 2001-2011, despite the decrease in 2011 compared to 2010. No explanation for the trends is available. This research results in more insight in the true incidence of foodborne diseases and the associated disease burden. The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) and Regional Health Services register and investigate outbreaks of foodborne disease in the Netherlands.

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and monetary losses, resulting from human and livestock CE, were calculated from recorded human and livestock cases. Alternative values, assuming substantial underreporting, are also reported. When no underreporting is assumed, the estimated human burden of disease is 285,407 (95% confidence interval [CI], 218,515-366,133) DALYs or an annual loss of US $193,529,740 (95% CI, $171,567,331-$217,773,513). When underreporting is accounted for, this amount rises to 1,009,662 (95% CI, 862,119-1,175,654) DALYs or US $763,980,979 (95% CI, $676,048,731-$857,982,275). An annual livestock production loss of at least US $141,605,195 (95% CI, $101,011,553-$183,422,465) and possibly up to US $2,190,132,464 (95% CI, $1,572,373,055-$2,951,409,989) is also estimated.

Awareness of psittacosis and its presentations are low among clinicians and the general public. Therefore, underdiagnosis and thereby underestimation of the incidence and public health importance of psittacosis is very likely. We used the methodology developed for the Burden of communicable diseases in Europe toolkit of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to construct a model to estimate disease burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to psittacosis. Using this model, we estimated the disease burden caused by psittacosis in the Netherlands to have been 222 DALY per year (95% CI 172-280) over the period 2012-2014. This is comparable with the amount of DALYs estimated to be due to rubella or shigellosis in the same period in the Netherlands.

Daarom is een overzicht gemaakt van welke muggensoort welke ziekten kan overbrengen, en onder welke omstandigheden. Deze kennis is belangrijk om te kunnen bepalen of er een risico is voor de Nederlandse volksgezondheid.

The attributable risk of PI-IBS due to bacterial pathogens was calculated and linked to national data on gastroenteritis incidence and measures for severity and duration of illness in order to estimate the burden of PI-IBS. One year post-infection, IBS developed in 9% of patients with bacterial IID. The burden of PI-IBS adds over 2300 disability adjusted life years to the total annual disease burden for the selected pathogens. PI-IBS is a frequent sequel of IID, resulting in a considerable disease burden compared to other outcomes.

The estimated disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis in The Netherlands is 620 (range, 220–1900) disability-adjusted life years per year, which is similar to that for salmonellosis and is mainly caused by fetal loss and chorioretinitis. However, there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate. Scenario analysis indicates that the true burden may be underestimated. In other countries, the disease burden is expected to vary with the incidence of congenital infection, but it may also depend on the health care system. In countries that actively screen for toxoplasmosis, such as France, there may be a lower burden of morbidity but a higher burden of mortality.","Clinical Infectious Diseases","https://academic-oup-com.eur.idm.oclc.org/cid/article/44/11/1467/477171"
"73","Havelaar et al",2015,"World Health Organization Global Estimates and Regional Comparisons of the Burden of Foodborne Disease in 2010","Illness and death from diseases caused by contaminated food are a constant threat to public health and a significant impediment to socio-economic development worldwide. To measure the global and regional burden of foodborne disease (FBD), the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which here reports their first estimates of the incidence, mortality, and disease burden due to 31 foodborne hazards. We find that the global burden of FBD is comparable to those of the major infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The most frequent causes of foodborne illness were diarrheal disease agents, particularly norovirus and Campylobacter spp. Diarrheal disease agents, especially non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, were also responsible for the majority of deaths due to FBD. Other major causes of FBD deaths were Salmonella Typhi, Taenia solium and hepatitis A virus. The global burden of FBD caused by the 31 hazards in 2010 was 33 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); children under five years old bore 40% of this burden. The 14 subregions, defined on the basis of child and adult mortality, had considerably different burdens of FBD, with the greatest falling on the subregions in Africa, followed by the subregions in South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean D subregion. Some hazards, such as non-typhoidal S. enterica, were important causes of FBD in all regions of the world, whereas others, such as certain parasitic helminths, were highly localised. Thus, the burden of FBD is borne particularly by children under five years old–although they represent only 9% of the global population–and people living in low-income regions of the world. These estimates are conservative, i.e., underestimates rather than overestimates; further studies are needed to address the data gaps and limitations of the study. Nevertheless, all stakeholders can contribute to improvements in food safety throughout the food chain by incorporating these estimates into policy development at national and international levels.","PLoS Med","https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001923"
"74","Havelaar et al",2004,"Disease burden in The Netherlands due to infections with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157","Infection with Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli serotype O157 (STEC O157) may lead to a gastroenteritis (GE) episode. Symptoms can vary from relatively mild watery diarrhoea to a severe form of bloody diarrhoea known as haemorrhagic colitis. In children, and sporadically in adults, the Shiga toxin may cause the Haemolytic Uraemic syndrome (HUS). Some HUS patients may develop End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), either directly after the HUS episode or as many as 20 years later. ESRD patients are dependent on renal replacement therapy (dialysis, kidney transplantation) while GE, HUS and ESRD can all lead to premature mortality. Here, the epidemiology of illness associated with STEC O157 in the Netherlands is described on the basis of surveys carried out between 1990 and 2000. All available information is integrated in one public health measure, the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). The mean disease burden associated with STEC O157 in the Dutch population has been estimated through simulation at 116 DALY per year (85 - 160 DALY per year using a 90% confidence interval). The disease burden is also highly variable. Mortality due to HUS (58 DALY), mortality due to ESRD (21 DALY) and dialysis due to ESRD (21 DALY) constitute the main determinants of disease burden.

The burden-of-disease metric used was the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY), composed of years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) and due to disability (YLD). To better represent infectious diseases, a pathogen-based approach was used linking incident cases to sequelae through outcome trees. Health outcomes were included if an evidence-based causal relationship between infection and outcome was established. Life expectancy and disability weights were taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study and alternative studies. Disease progression parameters were based on literature. Countryspecific incidence was based on surveillance data corrected for underestimation. Non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. were used for illustration. Using the incidence- and pathogen-based DALY approach the total burden for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was estimated at 730 DALYs and at 1,780 DALYs per year in the Netherlands (average of 2005–2007). Sequelae accounted for 56% and 82% of the total burden of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., respectively. The incidence- and pathogen-based DALY methodology allows in the case of infectious diseases a more comprehensive calculation of the disease burden as subsequent sequelae are fully taken into account. Not considering subsequent sequelae would strongly underestimate the burden of infectious diseases. Estimates can be used to support prioritisation and comparison of infectious diseases and other health conditions, both within a country and between countries.","PLoS One","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079740&type=printable"

On average 18,000 patients consult a general practitioner and 500 patients are hospitalised; for some 30 cases the disease could be fatal. Additionally, each year some 1400 cases of reactive arthritis, 60 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and 10 cases of inflammatory bowel disease are associated with a previous Campylobacter infection. The disease burden and the cost-of-illness of Campylobacter infections and sequelae were estimated using a stochastic simulation model. Disease burden was expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability, weighted for the severity of disease. Considered in the cost-of-illness were direct health-care costs (e.g. doctors' consultations, hospitalisation, rehabilitation), direct non-health-care costs (e.g. travel costs of patients, co-payments by patients) and indirect non-health-care costs (productivity losses), using cost estimates for the year 2000. The disease burden associated with Campylobacter infections was estimated at 1200 DALYs per year, with a 90% uncertainty interval of between 900 and 1600 DALYs per year. The costs-of-illness were estimated to total 21 million per year with a 90% confidence interval of between 11 million and 36 million per year. Hence, Campylobacter infections pose an important public health problem for the Netherlands and incur substantial costs.","RIVM","https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/250911004.html"

In humans, its manifestations may range from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and possible death, and lead to economic losses from treatment costs and lost wages. Recent studies suggest that this disease has a large social impact in endemic areas, and estimates of burden in terms of monetary and no-monetary impact on human health are essential to allocate financial and technical resources. In Sardinia, the most affected Italian region per number of inhabitants, CE is still endemic, although three eradication campaigns have been carried out in 1962, 1978, and 1987, respectively. To date, the burden of human CE in Sardinia remains poorly defined. In this work, a retrospective study was carried out using public Hospital Discharge Records spanning from 2001 to 2009. During these years, a total of 1409 discharges were recorded: 1196 (84.88%) records corresponding to patients hospitalized for symptoms directly correlated to CE (primary diagnosis), and 213 (15.11%) records corresponding to patients hospitalized for symptoms not directly correlated to CE and with an afterwards or concurrent diagnosis of echinococcosis made during the hospitalization (secondary diagnosis). The annual regional average record (discharge rate) was 9.3/100,000 inhabitants. Direct cost associated with diagnosis, surgery or chemotherapy, medical care, and hospitalization in humans were evaluated in this work. Furthermore, burden of disease was also evaluated by using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the preferred disease-burden measure of the World Health Organization. Knowing the burden of human CE in Sardinia is extremely important to enable the prioritization of control measures for this preventable neglected disease. This is the first study describing the measure of the overall disease burden in an Italian region endemic for this disease, performed by calculating the number of CE patients from Hospital Discharge Records.","Acta Trop","https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eur.idm.oclc.org/22634205/"

Relative risks associated with this organism in powdered infant formula (PIF) have been described in several studies. To set priorities and decide on risk management options, it is important for risk managers to have a quantitative perspective on the absolute level of risk of this pathogen within the totality of the burden of illnesses in the population. This study set-out to establish such a perspective for The Netherlands. It addresses the impact of heterogeneity in the distribution of the micro-organism in PIF on risk levels. Based on the assumptions in this study, 60% of formula-fed infants are estimated not to be exposed to Cronobacter spp. during their neonatal period. The mean exposure was calculated to be about 1 cfu per infant over the total neonatal period. Even after thorough mixing, artificially contaminated powder shows counts which are more variable than expected from a normal, homogeneous distribution. Therefore, mean exposure levels may not represent a good basis for calculating risks. The burden of disease of Cronobacter infections to the Dutch population was estimated to be 19–24 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per year, of which 95% are due to meningitis. As compared to other illnesses Cronobacter infections represent 0.5–2.4% of the total estimated burden of foodborne infections and intoxications. The organism is estimated to be responsible for 0.5–0.7% of the meningitis burden to the entire population of The Netherlands","International Journal of Food Microbiology","https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/perspective-on-the-risk-to-infants-in-the-netherlands-associated-"

As an assessment it is purely descriptive. The chapter “Main results” contains references to the possible risk factors. The atlas is meant to serve as an impetus and an empirical basis for research on causes. It may be of benefi t for the development of hypotheses on the underlying causal factors and may incite specialized epidemiological studies in which these hypotheses can be tested. Finally, the atlas may contribute to an improvement in health-consciousness and serve to implement health policy strategies. In problem areas with a high risk of death, prevention and education programs could be intensifi ed, independently of whether or not the underlying causal factors have been identifi ed. For heath-planning purposes, specialist medical examination and treatment programs would need to be included in the strategies taken","Statistics Austria","https://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/PeopleSociety/health/causes_of_death/index.html"

We incorporated new insights gained over the past decade in an updated estimate of the disease burden of (foodborne) norovirus illness in The Netherlands in 2009. The disease outcomes – non-consulting cases, visiting a general practitioner, hospitalization and mortality – and the foodborne proportion were derived from cohort studies, surveillance data and literature. Age-specific incidence estimates were applied to the population age distribution in The Netherlands in 2009. The general population incidence was 3800/100 000 (95% CI 2670–5460), including 0. 4 fatal cases/100 000, resulting in 1622/100 000 (95% CI 966–2650) disability-adjusted life-years in a population of 16. 5 million. The updated burden of norovirus is over twofold higher than previously estimated, due in particular to the new insights in case-fatality ratios. Results suggest that the burden of norovirus institutional outbreaks is relatively small compared to the burden of community-acquired norovirus infections","Epidemiol Infect","https://www-cambridge-org.eur.idm.oclc.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/estimated-disease-burden-of-norovirus-in-the-netherlands/F2BCF6D351EAD17256DEF4C05D188A67"
